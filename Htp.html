        <h2>How to Play Blackjack</h2>
        <p>Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it. Here’s how you can play:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Card Values:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
                    <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.</li>
                    <li>Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what benefits your hand.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> 
                The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. If you exceed 21, you lose!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong>
                You’ll receive two cards, and the dealer gets two cards (one face-up). You’ll decide whether to hit (take a card), stand (keep your current hand), double down (double your bet for one more card), or split (split your hand if you have two identical cards).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Winning:</strong>
                - If your total is closer to 21 than the dealer’s, you win!
                - If you get 21 on your first two cards (Ace + 10), it’s a Blackjack and wins automatically!
                - If the dealer busts (goes over 21), you win as well.
            </li>
        </ul>
